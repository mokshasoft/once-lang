When selecting the solution to the fix problem there are many terms floating around:
- QTT, that we already use
- HoTT
- Polynomial Functors
- Sized Types
- Well-Founded
- QIITs
- Soundness
- Vec, Sigma, Pi, refinements
- CCC alignment 
- Sound by construction
- HoTT/cubical understanding
Well, if we remove QTT and implement erasure in another way, does that simplify the fix problem? Using only NT and HoTT? Or another combination of things?

For the formal verifiction, would it speed up if Correct.agda was broken up into several logical files?
